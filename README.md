### Objective
To create an colorful, online version of an 18th century table game that has endured into the modern era.


### Motivation
My husband introduced me to roulette on a vacation years ago. I fell in love with how social it is compared to many casino games. There is a comradere amongst the players. The only thing that could make this game better would be a rainbow of colors!


### Minimum Viable Product:
* As a player, I should be able to choose a persona.
* As a player, I should be able to make multiple bets on numbers and sections of the board.
* As a player, see the wheel activate before selecting a number.
* As a player, I should see the winning number clearly presented.
* As a player, I should see my $TOTAL increase or decrease after each round of betting.
* As a player, I should see PSYCHEDELIC MODE if I hit the winning number.
